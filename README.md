**Trader: A novel optimization algorithm**

This repository includes source code of 11 optimization algorithms which are:
Trader, WCC, ION, PSO, TE, EPO, TGA, VIR, DVBA, CEFOA and HTS. These codes are
avialable in the folder named "Algorithms".

Besides source codes, the created dataset is also available in the folder named
"Dataset" which two txt files are available in it:

1- dataset: this file contais known drug-target.

2- potentials_drugs_and_targets: This file entails all potential drug-target
interactions (unknown interactions) exclude known drug-target interactions.

These files consistis of:

1- drug: name of drug such as D.

2- target: name of target (enzyme) such as T.

3- S1: number of drugs which interact T exclude D.

4- S2: average similarity score between D and drugs of T.

5- S3: minimum similarity score between D and drugs of T.

6- S4: maximum similarity score between D and drugs of T.

7- S1: number of targets of T exclude D.

8- S2: average similarity score between T and targets of D.

9- S3: minimum similarity score between T and targets of D.

10- S4: maximum similarity score between T and targets of D.
